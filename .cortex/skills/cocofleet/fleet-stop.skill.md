Your objective is to stop a running CocoFleet.

Before proceeding, verify that `.cocoplus/` exists.
If not: output "CocoPlus is not initialized. Run `/pod init` first." Then stop.

Parse argument: `/fleet stop [fleet-id]`
If no fleet-id: output "Usage: /fleet stop [fleet-id]" Then stop.

Read `.cocoplus/fleet/[fleet-id]-state.json`. If not found: output "Fleet state not found for [fleet-id]." Then stop.

## Terminate Running Instances

For each instance with status == "running":
1. Read PID from state.json
2. Send SIGTERM: `kill -TERM [pid] 2>/dev/null || true`
3. Wait up to 10 seconds for graceful shutdown:
   ```bash
   for i in $(seq 1 10); do
     kill -0 [pid] 2>/dev/null || break
     sleep 1
   done
   ```
4. Send SIGKILL if still running: `kill -KILL [pid] 2>/dev/null || true`
5. Update state.json: status = "stopped", completed_at = [timestamp]

## Write Stop Record

Write `.cocoplus/fleet/[fleet-id]-stop-record.md`:
```markdown
# Fleet Stop Record

**Fleet ID:** [fleet-id]
**Stopped At:** [ISO 8601 timestamp]

## Instances Stopped
| Instance | Last Status | Last Checkpoint | PID |
|----------|-------------|-----------------|-----|
[one row per stopped instance]
```

Output: "Fleet [fleet-id] stopped. [N] processes terminated. Stop record: `.cocoplus/fleet/[fleet-id]-stop-record.md`."
