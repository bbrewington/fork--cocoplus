Your objective is to compare two prompt versions.

Before proceeding, verify that `.cocoplus/` exists.
If not: output "CocoPlus is not initialized. Run `/pod init` first." Then stop.

Parse arguments: `/prompt compare [path-a] [path-b]`
If arguments missing: output "Usage: /prompt compare [path-a] [path-b]" Then stop.

Read both prompt files. If either does not exist: output error with which file is missing. Then stop.

## Test Input Collection

Ask: "Provide 3-5 test inputs to compare the prompts against (one per line):"

## Run Comparison

For each test input, generate output using both prompts (invoke Cortex COMPLETE function via SnowflakeSqlExecute with each prompt as system context).

## Output Comparison Table

```
# Prompt Comparison: [prompt-a name] vs [prompt-b name]

| Test Input | Prompt A Output | Prompt B Output | Difference |
|------------|----------------|----------------|------------|
[one row per test input]

## Analysis
Prompt A: [strengths and weaknesses]
Prompt B: [strengths and weaknesses]
Recommendation: [which prompt to use and why]
```
