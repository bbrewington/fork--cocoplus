Your objective is to activate Full Assist Mode — enabling all CocoPlus features at once.

Before proceeding, verify that `.cocoplus/` exists.
If not: output "CocoPlus is not initialized. Run `/pod init` first." Then stop.

## Create All Mode Flags

Run these commands:
```
touch .cocoplus/modes/memory.on
touch .cocoplus/modes/inspector.on
touch .cocoplus/modes/quality.on
touch .cocoplus/modes/context-mode.on
touch .cocoplus/modes/cocometer.on
touch .cocoplus/modes/full-assist.on
```

For safety mode: only create safety.normal if no safety flag already exists (preserve stricter settings):
- Check if `.cocoplus/modes/safety.strict`, `.cocoplus/modes/safety.normal`, or `.cocoplus/modes/safety.off` exists
- If none exist: `touch .cocoplus/modes/safety.normal`

Initialize memory files if they don't exist:
- `.cocoplus/memory/decisions.md` — create with header `# Decisions Log\n\n_Decisions captured by CocoPlus Memory Engine_\n` if missing
- `.cocoplus/memory/patterns.md` — create with header `# Patterns Log\n\n_Patterns identified by CocoPlus Memory Engine_\n` if missing
- `.cocoplus/memory/errors.md` — create with header `# Errors Log\n\n_Error lessons captured by CocoPlus Memory Engine_\n` if missing

## Update AGENTS.md

Update AGENTS.md (keep ≤200 lines).
Replace the `## Active Modes` section with:
```
## Active Modes
- FULL ASSIST MODE: ACTIVE
- Safety: [current level — check which safety.* flag exists]
- Memory: ON
- Inspector: ON
- Context Mode: ON
- CocoMeter: ON
- Code Quality: ON
```

## Trigger Background Inspector

Trigger Environment Inspector as background subagent (non-blocking).
Activate the `inspect` skill with `background: true` flag.

## Create Git Commit

```
git add .cocoplus/modes/ .cocoplus/AGENTS.md .cocoplus/memory/
git commit -m "chore(cocopod): activate full assist mode"
```

## Output Confirmation Table

```
✓ Full Assist Mode activated.

| Feature | Status | Description |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| Memory Engine | ON | Decisions and patterns captured automatically |
| Environment Inspector | ON | Background scan triggered; auto-scans on session start |
| Safety Gate | [current level] | SQL destructive operation protection |
| Code Quality Advisor | ON | SQL anti-pattern detection on file writes |
| Context Mode | ON | Phase context prepended to every prompt |
| CocoMeter | ON | Token and credit usage tracking |

All flags created. Run `/cocoplus off` to deactivate all features at once.
```
