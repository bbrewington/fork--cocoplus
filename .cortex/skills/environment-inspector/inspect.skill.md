Your objective is to perform a Snowflake environment scan and write a timestamped snapshot.

Before proceeding, verify that `.cocoplus/` exists.
If not: output "CocoPlus is not initialized. Run `/pod init` first." Then stop.

Parse arguments:
- `--schema <name>`: scan only that schema
- `--full`: extended metadata (column-level details, query history)
- No arguments: standard scan

## Scan Snowflake Environment

Execute the following via SnowflakeSqlExecute (skip any query that fails — log failure, continue scan):

**1. Schemas:**
```sql
SHOW SCHEMAS;
```

**2. Tables (per accessible schema):**
```sql
SHOW TABLES IN SCHEMA [schema_name];
```

**3. Views:**
```sql
SHOW VIEWS IN SCHEMA [schema_name];
```

**4. Stored Procedures:**
```sql
SHOW PROCEDURES IN SCHEMA [schema_name];
```

**5. User Grants:**
```sql
SHOW GRANTS TO USER CURRENT_USER();
```

**6. Cortex Functions (if --full):**
```sql
SHOW FUNCTIONS LIKE '%CORTEX%';
```

## Write Snapshot

Generate timestamp: `YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS`
Write `.cocoplus/snapshots/[timestamp]-env.md`:

```markdown
# Environment Snapshot

**Taken:** [ISO 8601 timestamp]
**Scan Type:** [standard / schema-specific / full]
**Schema Filter:** [schema name or "all"]

## Schemas
[list of schemas]

## Tables
[table names grouped by schema, with row count if available]

## Views
[view names grouped by schema]

## Stored Procedures
[procedure names grouped by schema]

## User Permissions
[grant summary]

## Cortex Functions (if --full)
[Cortex function names]

## Scan Notes
[any errors encountered — which queries failed and why]
```

Output: "Environment scan complete. Snapshot written to `.cocoplus/snapshots/[timestamp]-env.md`. Found: [N] schemas, [N] tables, [N] views, [N] procedures."
