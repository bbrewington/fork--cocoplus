Your objective is to process Critical SecondEye findings and clear the build gate.

Before proceeding, verify that `.cocoplus/` exists.
If not: output "CocoPlus is not initialized. Run `/pod init` first." Then stop.

## Find Unacknowledged Reports

Scan `.cocoplus/lifecycle/` for files matching `secondeye-*.md`.
Read YAML frontmatter of each file.
Find files with `critical_open: true` AND `acknowledged: false`.

If none found:
Output: "No unacknowledged Critical SecondEye findings. /build is not gated." Then stop.

## Present Each Critical Finding

For each unacknowledged report:
Display all Critical findings.
For each finding ask:
"Acknowledge finding [SE-NNN]: [title]? (yes to acknowledge / no to keep it open)"

## Update Report Metadata

If all Critical findings acknowledged:
Update the report file's YAML frontmatter:
- `acknowledged: true`
- `acknowledged_at: [ISO 8601 timestamp]`
- `critical_open: false`

If any critical finding left unacknowledged:
Output: "[N] findings still unacknowledged. /build remains gated."

## Output

If all acknowledged:
Output: "All Critical findings acknowledged. /build gate cleared. You may now run `/build`."
