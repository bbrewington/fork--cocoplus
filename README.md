# CocoPlus

**CocoPlus** is an AI-powered development lifecycle plugin for the Snowflake Cortex Code CLI. It brings structured, multi-agent workflows to data engineering projects — covering everything from project initialization through spec, plan, build, test, review, and ship phases.

Built using only Coco-native constructs: Skills, Agents, Hooks, and AGENTS.md.

- **CocoHarvest** — Parallel specialist personas working in isolated git worktrees
- **CocoFlow** — JSON pipeline orchestration for multi-stage agent execution
- **CocoGrove** — Pattern library that learns from your project over time
